# Vercel Deployment Plan

- [x] **Consolidate API Logic**: Move all backend logic into the main Express application (`server/index.ts` and `server/routes.ts`).
- [x] **Modify Server Entry Point**: Adapt `server/index.ts` to export the Express app as a serverless function for Vercel.
- [x] **Update `vercel.json`**: Configure `vercel.json` to correctly build and route requests to the Express server and the static frontend.
- [x] **Remove Redundant Files**: Delete the now unnecessary `api/portfolio.ts` file.

- [ ] **Verify Deployment**: After applying the changes, I will guide you on how to deploy to Vercel and verify that everything is working as expected.
